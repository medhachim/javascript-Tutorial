    <h1><b><i>OOP: Encapsulation</i></b></h1>

            There for pillars of OOP. One of them is the encapsulation. They
            are encapsulation, abstraction, inheritance and polymorphism.<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Encapsulation:It is actually the process of binding data members and methods
            together in a unit.Each class in java itself is an example of encapsulation.
            It is just like capsule medicine that encapsulate the medicines in a 
            case(container) to binds the inner constituents into a unit to make it 
            safe from misuse.<br>
            For example: Same data type is encapsulate into a class. After that, it is 
            labelled private. It means that the data cannot be accessed from outside 
            unless it is allowed. Also, it means it's scope is within the class. Also,
            the name conflict and overwriteare avoided because of indentical variable 
            name.
