            It's not a programming language. It's not a tool. It's a model(style).

            Object oriented programming (OOP) is a programming language model 
            organized around objects rather than 'actions' and data rather than logic.<br>
            It's a model in which we use objects instead of functions or actions and use
            data instead of logic. Terms like object, class, data etc. are used.<br>
            Each and every problem is reckoned as an object(real world) and try to 
            solve it. It becomes easier to solve a problem in this way.
