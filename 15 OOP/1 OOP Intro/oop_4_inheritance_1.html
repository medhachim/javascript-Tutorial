            Inheritance: It means to acquire the properties inherited from 
            its kind.<br>
            It saves time from writing the same code again and again. Therefore, 
            it avoids the code redundancy.
            <br>
        </li>
        <li>
            In computer programming, redundant code is source code or compiled code
            in a computer program that is unnecessary, such as: ... code that is never
            executed (known as unreachable code), code which is executed but has no 
            external effect (e.g., does not change the output produced by a program; 
            known as dead code).
        </li>
        <li>
            In object-oriented programming, inheritance is the concept that when a 
            class of objects is defined, any subclass that is defined can inherit 
            the definitions of one or more general classes.
        </li>
         <li>
            For example: Let's take a mobile and samsung two classes.
            There common properties are model, price, ram, cpu, android, touch, switch on etc;<br>
            Therefore, samsung class can inherit the properties of mobile.
