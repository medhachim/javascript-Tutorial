            Abstraction: It means to make necessary things visible and to hide
            the rests.<br>

            In object-oriented programming, abstraction is one of three central 
            principles (along with encapsulation and inheritance). Through the process 
            of abstraction, a programmer hides all but the relevant data about an object 
            in order to reduce complexity and increase efficiency.<br>
            eg: We play and pause a video using a space bar on the keyboard or a button
            in the app. However, we are unaware of the process behind the scene in
            the background and it is hidden. Also, it means that a user is aware of only
            the need which is relevant to his use.
