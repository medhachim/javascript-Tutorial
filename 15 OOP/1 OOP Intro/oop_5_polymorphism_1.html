    <h1><b><i>OOP: Polymorphism</i></b></h1>
    <font size = 4 face = "arial"><ul>
        <li>
            <br>
           
        </li>
        <li>
            Example:<br>
            A button has a function to press.<br>
            When no 1 is pressed the output is 'balance'<br>
            When no 2 is pressed the output is 'data'<br>
            When no 3 is pressed the output is 'validity'<br>
            When no 4 is pressed the output is 'customer care'<br>
            Here the function is same 'press button' but the input and output
            are different.<br>
            The function chooses the block of statment to be executed for the 
            output according to the input given. When we press 1 or 3, the
            same button function is called but executing different block of
            statment for which input it is framed. So, it is possible because
            of the polymorphism concept.
