    <h1>Prototype in JavaScript</h1>
    <script src = "1prototype_javascript.js">
    </script>
    <p>The console details are as follows.</p>
    <img src = "console1.jpg"/><br/>
    
    <p>The console details for nokia do not have the color property.</p>
    <img src = "console2.jpg"/><br/>
    <p>The JavaScript codes are in the picture below. The property created
        outside the scope is available only for the object it was built
        for and not for the other object like nokia. In the above console
        picture, you can see that nokia has no access to that color property.
        In order to defined the property for nokia then extra property has 
        to be built.
        In this way we have to create thousands of color property for other
        objects.<br/>
        However, here comes the concept of prototype to overcome this
        complication.<br/>
        The syntax is:<br/>
        class_name.prototype.key = 'value';

    </p>
    <img src = "codes1.jpg"/><br/>
    <p>Creating prototype: Now, the object</p>
    <img src = "codes2.jpg"/><br/>
    <p>The console log: In the console log the property color is 
        visible under _proto_ category.<br/>
    </p>
    <img src = "console3.jpg"/><br/>
