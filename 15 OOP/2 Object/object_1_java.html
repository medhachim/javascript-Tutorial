            An object is a collection of properties, and a property is an association
            (having a link) between name(a key) and a value(a string, an integer,
            a function etc). A property's value can be a function, in that case the
            property is known as a method. In addition to objects that predefined int
            he browser, you can define your own object.<br>
            Eg:<br>
            var fees = {<br>//fees is the name of the object and below are its members<br>
                Rahul: 100,//properties of the object fees<br>
                Sunil: 200,//properties of the object fees<br>
                Irene: 400,//properties of the object fees<br>
                total: fucntion(){return(100+200+400);}// a function is used in this
                property and it is called the method of the object fees<br>
            }<br>
        </p>
