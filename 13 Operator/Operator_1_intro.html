    <p>In JavaScript, operators are used to assign values, 
        compare values, perform arithmetic operations, and more.

        var a = 20;
        var b = 30;
        var sum = a + b;
        var difference = 50 - b;
        document.write("The sum is "+sum)//Result is 50
        document.write("The difference is "+ difference)//The result is 20
        //sum, a and b are the operands and the symbols '=' and '+' are the 
        //operators. '=' is an assignment and '+' is an arithmetic operators.
        //Assignment operator assigns a value and arithmetic operators does the 
        //arithmetic calculations.
        //Combination of operands and operators are called an expression. 
        //var sum = a + b; is an expression.
