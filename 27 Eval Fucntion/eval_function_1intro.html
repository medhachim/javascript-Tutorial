                eval() function is not used widely as it is considered malicious.

                The reason eval is generally considered dangerous is because it is 
                very easy for untrusted code to sneak in. ... An attacker could create 
                a specially crafted form that posts to your form with the same cookie-
                stealing code.

            History and uses of eval()
            Eval has existed since the first ECMA specification published in June 1997. 
            It is specified by the following on page 32 of the spec:
            Eval code is the source text supplied to the built-in eval function. More 
            precisely, if the parameter to the built-in eval function is a string, it is 
            treated as an ECMAScript Program. The eval code for a particular invocation 
            of eval is the global code portion of the string parameter. — ECMA 262, 1st 
            Edition, June 1997
            Eval() is an instance of a meta-circular evaluator, or a language interpreter 
            that can be used within itself. Many other programming languages contain an 
            eval-like function, including Ruby, Python, and Perl.
            While often misused, it can be useful for allowing generated code to run at 
            a given point. While under controlled conditions, this is not a major issue, 
            the general consensus amongst the Javascript community is that you should 
            rarely if ever use it. Here’s a list of applications in which you must use 
            eval():
            1. Running code remotely sent from a server
            2. Evaluating user input code**
            3. Running dynamically generated code
            4. Running a script and storing its result
            While applications 1,3, and 4 are generally safe, there are real security 
            concerns to our second application — evaluating user input code.
