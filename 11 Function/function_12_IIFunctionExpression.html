    <h1><b>IIFE(Immediately Invoked Function Expression)</h1>
        It is a JavaScript Function that runs as soon as it is defined. It is not needed to call. It is called
        by itself. <br>
        It is a design pattern which is also known as Self-Executing Anonymous Function
        and contains two major parts.<br>
        The first is anonymous with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator(). This prevents accessing variables 
        within IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.<br>
        The second part is creating the immediately executing functin expression(),
        through which the JavaScript engine will directly interprete the function.
    </b><br>
    <ul>Points to remember.<br>
        <li>
            Avoid creating global variable and functions. It's a bad practice to have
            plenty of global variable.
        </li>
        <li>
            As it doesn't define a variable and function globally, there will be no
            name conflict.
        </li>
        <li>
            Scope is limited to that particular function. A variable created inside IIFE
            function, it's scope is limited to that IIFE function only. It cannot be accessed
            from outside.
        </li>
    </ul>

    Syntax:<br>
        //(first part)(second part);<br>
        eg:(function(){document.write("Rose Tamang");})();<br>
        passing parameter in the second part<br>
        eg:(functin(a,b){document.write(a+ " "+b);})(10,20);<br>
