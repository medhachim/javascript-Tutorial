    <ol>
        <li>
            Closure is a function having access to the parent scope. It preserves the 
            data from outside.<br>
            var i = 10; // parent scope <br>
            function show()<br>
            {<br>
                var j = 20;<br>
                document.write(j);<br>
                document.write(i); //Can access the parent scope(outside)<br>
                // Here closure is created between the two scope;<br>
            }<br>
            show();<br>
        </li>
        <li>
            Closure is an inner function that has access to outer (enclosing) function's
            variables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Every closure has three scopes.<br>
            a. Local Scope (Own Scope)<br>
            b. Outer Function's Scope<br>
                i) The function inside the function is an inner function and the 
                function which is outside is the outer function. The inner function
                can access the variable of outer function. The closure function
                is also called nested function.<br>
            c. Global Scope<br>
