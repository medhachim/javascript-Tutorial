    <h1>Keyword: var let const.</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Var: The scope of variable declared with var is its current
            execution context, which is either the enclosing function or, 
            for variables declared outside any function, global. A variable
            formed with var is attached with the window object. They become
            the properties of window object.
        </li>
        <li>
            let: let allows you to declare variables that are limited in scope
            to the block, statement, or expression on which it is used. It becomes
            useless outside the block.
        </li>
        <li>
            const: This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global
            or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not become
            properties of the window object, unlike var variables. An initializer for a
            constant is required: that is, you must specify its value in the same statement
            in which it's delcared which can't be changed later. eg: value of pi = 22/7
            which cannot be changed.
        </li>
    </ul>

    The property method of window is displayed in the picture below. var a becomes the 
    property of the window object. But you cannot see b or c.<br>
    A good practice is to create a variable with let or const keyword.<br>
